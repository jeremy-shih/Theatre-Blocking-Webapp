# #Objective Statement

A theatre blocking app that allows directors to modify the blocking for all parts of the script and actors to see the blocking for their parts to shorten rehearsal times and help those involved easier locate those on stage.

# #Personas

Create **three** **personas** of potential users of the app.

1. Romeo the actor is a great actor but has bad memory, so he needs something to remind him of where he needs to be at each part of a the play he is in.

2. Emma the renouned director works three jobs so she needs to cut down on time that is wasted on rehearsal.

3. Jack the impatient and controlling director likes things his way and wants an app that can help him make immediate changes to actor's position on the stage.

# #User Stories

1. As an actor in a play that uses the theatre booking webapp, Romeo wants to easily be able to know where he needs to be at each part of the play so that he doesn't run into anyone during the play's transitions and so that he is able to get to his position without any delays.

2. As the director of a play that uses the theatre booking webapp, Emma wants to be able to change the blocking for all parts of the script and have a way so all actors are able to know their new positions immediately so that rehearsal time is cut short and all actors know where they need to be.  
3. As the director of a play that uses the theatre booking webapp, Jack wants to have an easy way to modify the blocking for all parts of the script so he can make changes to each actor's position quickly and easily.

# #Acceptance Criteria
